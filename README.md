# Dissertation
Android Game Development in C#

The dissertation revolved around attempting to create a game for Android using Unity3D in C#. 
The repository will contain all the individual components integrated in the game..
Note that asset packages were used for the dissertation but are not included in the repository as they are free in the public Asset Store
and does not showcase my coding.

Enjoy!
